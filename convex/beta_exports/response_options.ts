      'Conducting regular board performance assessments is essential for promoting accountability, governance effectiveness, compliance, strategic alignment, and continuous improvement within not-for-profit organisations. By regularly evaluating and enhancing board performance, organisations can strengthen their capacity for achieving mission-driven impact and fulfilling their commitment to stakeholders.  \n\nRegular Board assessments will also help new Board members align with behavioural and compliance expectations sooner, maximising their contribution from the start. \n\nIt is recommended that the Board schedule annual Board assessments using GovernApp.  Our recommended timing is Q3 of your financial year.  This allows time to review the assessment outcomes, consolidate and update the generated GovernApp action plan, and report the fact of the assessment and the actions undertaken and planned to your Annual General Meeting.  This will maximise your accountability to members and ensure an ongoing focus on continuously improving Board governance.\n\nA review of the progress made against the GovernApp action plan should be a standing item on your Board meetings.\n\nAll new Board members should conduct a GovernApp self-assessment to help them get up to speed with governance concepts, language and expectations, and to identify areas where they need to come rapidly up to speed in order to maximise their Board contribution.',

      "Congratulations on undertaking some form of regular Board assessments.\n\nIf you conduct multiple assessments during each year, consider optimising your assessments by using GovernApp's Domain assessment feature.  GovernApp's assessment frameworks are divided into Domains.  When initiating an assessment, you can select the specific Domains you wish to assess - from a single Domain to all Domains in the framework.   This means that you can split a full Board assessment across a year by dividing the Domains across the number of assessments you wish to run over the year.  \n\nSuch an approach can be helpful in a number of scenarios.  If the Board is new, a gradual approach focussing on key compliance areas (such as Policies) may help the Board establish well.  A dysfunctional Board may wish to focus on performance issues before anything else.  Or the fact of conducting smaller, more frequent assessments may help the Board digest and complete recommended actions in a more even manner across each year, rather than being faced with a single, large action plan. \n\nWhether in multiple parts or as a single exercise, we recommend conducting a full coverage Board assessment across each financial year.  A review of the progress made against the GovernApp action plan should be a standing item on your Board meetings.\n\nAll new Board members should conduct a GovernApp self-assessment to help them get up to speed with governance concepts, language and expectations, and to identify areas where they need to come rapidly up to speed in order to maximise their Board contribution.",

This can help in understanding the dynamics and prioritising stakeholders based on their impact and interest.\n\nClearly define and categorise stakeholders into internal (e.g., employees, volunteers, board members) and external groups (e.g., donors, beneficiaries, partners, regulatory bodies).   Consider what regular communication channels (such as newsletters, emails, or forums) could keep stakeholders informed and engaged.  Importantly, the Board should ensure that its own composition includes balanced representation from key stakeholder groups.  This will promote the alignment of organisational strategies to stakeholder imperatives.\n\nFor organisations of larger scale, the Board may consider establishing advisory committees from various stakeholder groups that can provide regular input and advice on specific issues or projects.  There may also be benefit in providing training sessions for board members on stakeholder management and engagement strategies, including workshops on communication skills, conflict resolution, and cultural competency.',

      'Please read the following regarding insolvency:\n\nInsolvency refers to a financial state in which an organisation is unable to pay debts as they become due.  An indicator that an organisation is heading towards (or is in) insolvency arises when when liabilities exceed assets.

This includes approving budgets, monitoring financial performance, and making strategic financial decisions.\n\n - Monitoring and Evaluation: The Board monitors the organisation's performance against its strategic objectives. Regular assessments help the Board determine whether the organisation is on track and whether adjustments to the strategy are needed.\n\n - Leadership and Oversight: The Board provides leadership and oversight to the organisation's executive leadership team.

      "Congratulations on completing regular Board assessments.\n\nIf you conduct multiple assessments during each year, consider optimising your assessments by using GovernApp's Domain assessment feature.  GovernApp's assessment frameworks are divided into Domains.  When initiating an assessment, you can select the specific Domains you wish to assess - from a single Domain to all Domains in the framework.   This means that you can split a full Board assessment across a year by dividing the Domains across the number of assessments you wish to run over the year.  \n\nSuch an approach can be helpful in a number of scenarios.  If the Board is new, a gradual approach focussing on key compliance areas (such as Policies) may help the Board establish well.  A dysfunctional Board may wish to focus on performance issues before anything else.  Or the fact of conducting smaller, more frequent assessments may help the Board digest and complete recommended actions in a more even manner across each year, rather than being faced with a single, large action plan. \n\nWhether in multiple parts or as a single exercise, we recommend conducting a full coverage Board assessment across each financial year.  A review of the progress made against the GovernApp action plan should be a standing item on your Board meetings.\n\nAll new Board members should conduct a GovernApp self-assessment to help them get up to speed with governance concepts, language and expectations, and to identify areas where they need to come rapidly up to speed in order to maximise their Board contribution.",

      'In addition to conducting pre-appointment and annual disqualification checks, it is good practice for Board members to sign a declaration confirming they are not disqualified.  This ensures all Board members understand their obligations and the consequences of being disqualified.  This practice promotes personal accountability, while creating a clear audit trail that demonstrates the organisation’s compliance with ACNC governance standards.\n\nTo implement this process it is helpful to use a standardised declaration form that includes:\n - A statement confirming the individual is not disqualified under applicable laws.\n - A brief explanation of what disqualification means (being bankrupt, having certain criminal convictions, or being disqualified by ASIC or ACNC).\n - An acknowledgement that the individual understands their duty to inform the organisation if their status changes.\n - The undertaking to renew declarations annually to ensure ongoing compliance and awareness.\n\nThe ACNC provides a helpful template for this declaration at https:\/\/www.acnc.gov.au\/tools\/templates\/governance-standard-4-declaration-for-responsible-people.',

      'Standard 3.6 requires that "The governing body must keep written minutes of all meetings, documenting all decisions made."  \n\nMinutes of Board meetings are crucial because they serve as an official and legal record of the decisions made, actions taken, and discussions held by the governing body.  Properly documented minutes provide transparency, accountability, and evidence of good governance. They demonstrate that the Board is fulfilling its legal, fiduciary, and ethical obligations.  Minutes also help resolve disputes or clarify decisions if misunderstandings or challenges arise.  Additionally, they serve as a historical record for the organisation, ensuring continuity in governance and aiding future Board members in understanding past actions and policies.\n\nThe Board should review and upgrade the practice of taking, distributing and approving minutes.  See our Model Practice: Taking Effective Board Minutes for a guide to consistent, good quality minute taking.',

While accepting that these are voluntary roles, the expectation of consistent Board meeting attendance should be included in the Board's charter, statements of duties, and reinforced through your induction process.\n\nThe inability to make quorum at some meetings is a major risk flag.  If an NFP Board is regularly struggling to make quorum for its meetings, it needs to address the issue promptly to ensure the board can meet its legal and governance obligations.  Some options the board may consider to resolve this issue include:\n\n - If appropriate and permitted, amend the governing documents to reduce the quorum threshold. This requires following the procedures outlined in the constitution, which may involve a special resolution at a general meeting or approval by members;\n - Recruit additional board members to increase the pool of participants. Focus on individuals who align with the NFP's mission and have the time and commitment to attend meetings regularly;\n - Schedule board meetings well in advance to accommodate members' commitments;\n - Allow remote participation through video conferencing or teleconferencing to make it easier for members to attend;\n - Speak with board members to understand why attendance is low. Barriers may include time constraints, lack of engagement, or unclear responsibilities;\n - If certain members consistently fail to attend and affect quorum, consider their removal according to the procedures outlined in the governing documents; or\n - Delegate some decision-making authority to committees or subgroups of the board that can meet quorum more easily. Major decisions should still be reserved for full board meetings.",

It must state that any remaining assets will be transferred to another charity with similar purposes rather than being distributed to members or individuals.\n\nAmendment Clause:\n\nA clause specifying that any changes to the constitution must not alter the organisation’s not-for-profit and charitable nature. Changes to the constitution should ensure that the organisation remains eligible to be registered as a charity.",

Schedule an annual review of these controls.\n\nYour controls should be commensurate with your organisation size, capability and risk profile.  Overly detailed controls can become a burden and constraint on your organisation.  Smaller charities should focus on the essential controls; segregation of duties, expenditure approvals, and basic financial management.  Medium to larger charities can expand their  controls to include comprehensive governance policies, automated financial systems, and periodic external audits.',

Here are several strategies the board can consider:\n\nPrioritise Agenda Items: Review the standing agenda items and prioritise them based on their importance and urgency. Consider whether some items can be addressed outside of board meetings or delegated to committees or working groups.\n\nStreamline Discussions: Encourage more efficient and focused discussions during board meetings by setting clear expectations for participation, limiting repetitive or tangential discussions, and ensuring that each agenda item receives adequate time without unnecessary delays.\n\nTime Allocation: Allocate specific time limits to each agenda item to ensure that no single item dominates the meeting. Consider using a timekeeper or agenda moderator to help enforce time limits and keep discussions on track.\n\nRotate Agenda Items: Rotate standing agenda items on a periodic basis to allow for greater flexibility and variety in meeting topics. This approach ensures that different areas of the organization receive attention over time and prevents meetings from becoming too predictable or repetitive.\n\nCommittee Reports: Limit the length of committee reports and focus on key highlights, decisions, and action items. Encourage committees to provide written reports in advance of the meeting to allow board members to review them independently.\n\nConsent Agenda: Group routine or non-controversial items together into a consent agenda that can be approved with a single vote, freeing up more time for discussion of substantive issues.\n\nConsider also scheduling occasional off site retreats or workshops to delve deeper into strategic planning, team building, or other important topics that may require more time than regular board meetings allow.',

Board members who have already read the materials can focus on discussing key points, asking clarifying questions, and making decisions, rather than spending valuable meeting time on reading through documents.\n\nQuality of Discussion: Pre-reading enables board members to delve deeper into complex issues and engage in more informed discussions during the meeting, allowing for more meaningful dialogue, exploration of different perspectives, and consideration of potential implications or risks.\n\nEffective Decision-Making: Well-prepared board members are better equipped to make informed decisions, with the necessary context and information to evaluate options, assess potential outcomes, and make decisions.\n\nAccountability: Engaging in pre-reading demonstrates a commitment to fulfilling one's responsibilities as a board member and respect for the time and efforts of fellow board members.\n\nRisk Management: By reviewing financial statements, reports, and other relevant documents before the meeting, board members can identify potential risks or issues that require further discussion or action. \n\nThe Board should collectively commit to reading Board meeting materials in full before attending each Board meeting.  such a commitment may be expressed in the Board Charter and emphasised during Board member recruitment and induction.\n\nTo enable effective pre-reading, those preparing the agenda and pre-reading materials must commit to providing the information with sufficient notice to reasonably allow the Board to properly consume those materials before the Board meeting.

      'Allowing a small clique to dominate discussions on an NFP board can have several negative consequences, including limiting the diversity of perspectives and ideas brought to the table, loss of objectivity, undermining trust and cohesion, decreased accountability, and lack of engagement among the Board members who feel marginalized or excluded.  \n\nFurther, in extreme cases, a dominant clique may engage in behavior that violates legal or ethical standards, such as conflicts of interest, or breaches of fiduciary duty. This can expose the organisation to legal liabilities, reputational damage, and loss of public trust.\n\nResolving a situation where a small clique dominates discussions on an NFP board requires a strategic and collaborative approach. Some steps for the Board to consider that can help address this issue include:\n\n - Consider engaging an external facilitator or mediator to help navigate challenging dynamics within the board. An impartial third party can facilitate productive discussions, mediate conflicts, and support the board in developing strategies for improved collaboration and decision-making.\n\n - Implement a system for rotating leadership roles, such as the chairperson of committee chair positions, to prevent any one individual or group from monopolizing power or influence over board discussions. This can promote a more equitable distribution of leadership responsibilities and opportunities for all members.\n\n - Establish clear ground rules for board meetings that promote fairness, respect, and inclusivity.  These rules may include guidelines for speaking time, respectful disagreement, and addressing conflicts of interest or biases.\n\n - Encourage a culture of open communication where all board members feel comfortable expressing their opinions and ideas.  Establish norms that prioritise active listening, respect for diverse viewpoints, and constructive dialogue.\n\n - Actively seek to involve all board members in discussions and decision-making processes.  Ensure that meetings are structured to provide opportunities for participation from every member, and actively solicit input from those who may be less vocal or assertive.\n\n - Strive to diversify the composition of the board to ensure a broader range of perspectives and experiences are represented. Consider recruiting new members who bring different backgrounds, skills, and expertise to the table, thereby reducing the influence of any single group or faction.',

      'When the standing agenda items consistently consume all the available time for nonprofit board meetings, it may indicate a need for adjustment to ensure that other important topics are adequately addressed. Here are several strategies the board can consider:\n\nPrioritizs Agenda Items: Review the standing agenda items and prioritise them based on their importance and urgency. Consider whether some items can be addressed outside of board meetings or delegated to committees or working groups.\n\nStreamline Discussions: Encourage more efficient and focused discussions during board meetings by setting clear expectations for participation, limiting repetitive or tangential discussions, and ensuring that each agenda item receives adequate time without unnecessary delays.\n\nTime Allocation: Allocate specific time limits to each agenda item to ensure that no single item dominates the meeting. Consider using a timekeeper or agenda moderator to help enforce time limits and keep discussions on track.\n\nRotate Agenda Items: Rotate standing agenda items on a periodic basis to allow for greater flexibility and variety in meeting topics. This approach ensures that different areas of the organization receive attention over time and prevents meetings from becoming too predictable or repetitive.\n\nCommittee Reports: Limit the length of committee reports and focus on key highlights, decisions, and action items. Encourage committees to provide written reports in advance of the meeting to allow board members to review them independently.\n\nConsent Agenda: Group routine or non-controversial items together into a consent agenda that can be approved with a single vote, freeing up more time for discussion of substantive issues.\n\nConsider also scheduling occasional off site retreats or workshops to delve deeper into strategic planning, team building, or other important topics that may require more time than regular board meetings allow.',

Seeking independent third party facilitation for the resolution process is strongly recommended.  \n\nFor the resolution process itself, consider the following approach.\n\n1. Define and communicate clear expectations for board members regarding their roles, responsibilities, and conduct. Establish norms for respectful communication, constructive disagreement, and consensus-building to create a positive and productive board culture.\n\n2. Encourage transparency and open communication among board members. Provide regular opportunities for board discussions, feedback, and updates on organisational matters. Create a safe space for board members to express their views and concerns openly.\n\n3.

      "A good rate of attendance at board meetings would typically be around 75% or higher. This means that most board members are consistently present at meetings, actively participating in discussions, and contributing to decision-making processes.\n\nHowever, it's important to recognise that occasional absences are inevitable due to conflicts with other commitments, illness, or personal reasons. Therefore, some degree of flexibility is reasonable.\n\nConsistently low attendance rates can be a cause for concern as it may indicate disengagement or lack of commitment from board members. It can also impede the board's ability to function effectively and fulfill its responsibilities.\n\nTo promote higher attendance rates, the Board should:\n\n - Establish clear expectations for attendance in board member position descriptions and in the Governance Policy.\n - Schedule meetings well in advance to accommodate board members' schedules.\n - Provide opportunities for remote participation through video conferencing or teleconferencing.\n - Encourage open communication and transparency regarding scheduling conflicts.\n - Assess the reasons behind low attendance and address any underlying issues proactively.\n\nIf the poor attendance is predominantly due to particular Board members who persistently fail to attend without notice or good reason, and if that behaviour does not alter after appropriate feedback, the Board should consider removing these members and appointing others who are more able to fulfil their obligations and make good contribution.",

Use features like screen sharing and virtual whiteboards to facilitate more interactive and engaging discussions.\n\nBy implementing some of these mechanisms, Boards can enhance the clarity, efficiency, and effectiveness of their written and verbal communications, leading to better decision-making and governance.',

It creates a narrative that innovation is a continuation of the organisation's journey rather than a departure from it.\n\nThe Board can balance history and innovation by:\n\n - The use of storytelling to highlight how the organisation’s history aligns with its current and future goals. Sharing stories of past successes and lessons learned can illustrate a commitment to the organisation’s roots while promoting new initiatives.  \n - Setting strategic goals that honor the organisation’s legacy while identifying opportunities for growth and change. \n - Analysing and levering historical data to understand trends, successes, and areas for improvement will evidence a commitment to historical respect while ensuring that new initiatives are evidence-based and likely to succeed.\n - Celebrating organisational milestones and achievements such as anniversaries, major project completions, or significant contributions from individuals. These celebrations reinforce the importance of the organisation’s history and recognise the progress being made.",

If the Board meets less frequently than monthly, these reports can be issued by email circular, without the need for full Board reports.\n\nNote, small organisations may suffice with quarterly financial reports.",

      "Poor financial literacy among an NFP board poses significant risks.  The inability to effectively oversee and manage the organisation’s financial resources can lead to potential mismanagement and financial instability, ultimately compromising the organisation's sustainability and its ability to fulfill its mission.  It can open the doorway to unscrupulous or corrupt actions within the organisation.  Additionally, lack of financial understanding can lead to non-compliance with regulatory and reporting requirements, increasing the risk of legal penalties and loss of donor confidence. \n\nThe Board should act with urgency to increase its financial literacy.  This applies to the whole Board, which - irrespective of individual roles - carries a shared obligation for the efficient and effective oversight of the organisation.\n\nOptions to increase financial literacy include:\n\n - Enroll board members in online courses focused on financial literacy for NFPs;\n - Recruit a Board Treasurer with financial expertise;\n - Engage an external financial advisor or accountant to provide ongoing support and guidance;\n - Ensure that financial reports provided to the Board by Executive management are easy to understand, using clear language and visual aids like graphs and charts;\n - Form a finance sub-committee comprising members with financial expertise to oversee financial matters and report back to the full board;\n - Implement financial dashboards that present key financial metrics in an accessible format; and\n - Create a glossary of financial terms and a guide to reading financial statements for board members.",

      'Overcommitting in a strategic plan can strain resources, compromise quality, disillusion stakeholders, create operational inefficiencies, lower morale, and undermine future strategic planning efforts. NFPs must set realistic and achievable goals to maintain focus, quality, and stakeholder trust.\n\nWhile aspiring to do more and\/or develop stretch goals for the organisation is commendable, without a realistic plan of how to acquire, the skills, resources and capacity it needs to carry out the Strategic Plan, it is almost certain that the Plan will fail.  The Strategic Planning process should include Executive Management to ensure that the organisation\'s capabilities and capacities are respected.\n\nOrganisations, like freeways, have an inherent capacity to take "traffic" - that is, a combination of business-as-usual (BAU) and new project work.  And organisations that try to do too much at once - run too many simultaneous projects alongside BAU - will, like over-crowded roads, end up going more slowly.  Starting a project when there are already too many projects in train will mean that the project - like a car stuck in rush hour - will take much longer to arrive at its planned destination.\n\nLarger organisations may utilise Enterprise Project Management Offices and Demand Management functions to prioritise, sequence and plan resources for Strategic Plan projects within capacity constraints.  Procurement functions may acquire more resources, technology or services to increase organisational capability and capacity.  Smaller organisations should consider the resources required to sustain business as usual, and limit new projects to the left over capacity available.  Ideally, smaller organisations should undertake one project at a time, with priorities guided by the strategic plan. \n\nIf the current plan has patently overcommitted the organisation, the Board should work with the Executive Leadership to reduce the current commitments of the Plan.  This may involve careful negotiation between Board members and\/or Executives who have strong personal commitment to particular projects.  High functioning Boards are able to rationally prioritise work based on the degree of contribution to achieving the strategic plan, balanced against the need to sequence project work where inter-project dependencies exist.',

      'A charitable purpose is essentially the mission of the organisation.  A charity undertakes activities in support of its overarching purpose.  It is important for your charity to be able to explain how your activities contribute toward achieving your charitable purpose(s).  \n\nThe following strategies can help you to demonstrate how your activities help you pursue your charitable purposes.  Reflect on these strategies and determine which to implement that will help you most effectively demonstrate the linking of your activities to your mission.\n\n - Explicitly connect each activity to the charity’s stated purposes. For example, if a charity’s purpose is to provide education to underprivileged children, describe how specific educational programs or scholarships fulfill this purpose.\n - Develop and use metrics to measure the outcomes of activities. For instance, if a charity provides healthcare services, metrics might include the number of patients treated, improvements in health outcomes, or community health statistics.\n - Include a detailed section in the annual report that maps activities to charitable purposes. Explain how each major activity contributes to achieving the mission.\n - Provide clear financial reports that show how funds are allocated towards activities that fulfill the charitable purposes.\n - Conduct regular evaluations of programs and projects to assess their effectiveness in achieving the charity’s goals.\n - Use independent evaluations or audits to provide an unbiased assessment of how well activities are aligned with purposes.\n - Use the charity’s website, newsletters, and social media platforms to regularly communicate how activities support the mission. Highlight specific projects and their outcomes.\n - Ensure compliance with reporting requirements set by regulatory bodies like the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC). This often includes demonstrating how activities support the charitable purposes.',

      "Your responses suggest that the Board is unsure how the organisation's activities help it pursue its charitable purposes.  \n\nA charitable purpose is essentially the mission of the organisation.  A charity undertakes activities in support of its overarching purpose.  It is important for your charity to be able to explain how your activities contribute toward achieving your charitable purpose(s).  \n\nTo gain clarity about the link between activity and purpose, the following strategies can help.  Reflect on these strategies and determine which to implement that will help you most effectively demonstrate the linking of your activities to your mission.\n\n - Explicitly connect each activity to the charity’s stated purposes. For example, if a charity’s purpose is to provide education to underprivileged children, describe how specific educational programs or scholarships fulfill this purpose.\n - Develop and use metrics to measure the outcomes of activities. For instance, if a charity provides healthcare services, metrics might include the number of patients treated, improvements in health outcomes, or community health statistics.\n - Include a detailed section in the annual report that maps activities to charitable purposes. Explain how each major activity contributes to achieving the mission.\n - Provide clear financial reports that show how funds are allocated towards activities that fulfill the charitable purposes.\n - Conduct regular evaluations of programs and projects to assess their effectiveness in achieving the charity’s goals.\n - Use independent evaluations or audits to provide an unbiased assessment of how well activities are aligned with purposes.\n - Use the charity’s website, newsletters, and social media platforms to regularly communicate how activities support the mission. Highlight specific projects and their outcomes.\n - Ensure compliance with reporting requirements set by regulatory bodies like the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC). This often includes demonstrating how activities support the charitable purposes.",

This can be a substantial exercise: for a good starting point we recommend we recommend you download and adopt the Victorian Government financial policies and procedures manual template, which is an excellent template for NFPs;\n - Develop an annual budget, and ensure the reporting of financial actuals vs budget in the Board papers;\n - Ensure that your Charity financials are properly reviewed in your Board meetings.  Ensure that the Board has confidence that the organisation is solvent.  Record a declaration of solvency in your Board minutes; and \n - Identify all the insurances your Charity requires, be sure to acquire them, store copies of the insurance certificates in a location known to, and accessible by, the Board, and make calendar entries for renewal dates.",

      "Breaches can be categorised into two key groups.  The first category can be termed procedural non-compliance.  This includes items such as: \n\n - Not submitting annual information statements, financial reports, or other required documentation by the specified deadlines.\n - Failing to advise the ACNC of changes to Responsible Persons\n - Failure to notify the ACNC of changes such as address, ABN and other notifiable items\n - Failing to adhere to the ACNC's governance standards, which require charities to operate in a way that is accountable, transparent, and aligns with their charitable purposes.\n\nThe second category can be termed serious legal breaches, and can include:\n\n - Using funds for non-charitable purposes, or for private gain rather than for the benefit of the public.\n - Engaging in activities that are not aligned with charitable purposes.\n - Submitting inaccurate or misleading information in reports or communications with the ACNC.\n - Engaging in illegal activities, including financial mismanagement, fraud, or other criminal behavior.\n - Not complying with directions issued by the ACNC to rectify issues within the charity.\n\nThe risks of procedural non-compliances are readily handled by the annual completion of a GovernApp review using the ACNC Charity Self-Evaluation framework (this framework).  This is designed to help you capture any inadvertent errors made or gaps in your systems.\n\nSerious legal breaches are more serious and rely on the fair and honest efforts of Responsible Persons to avoid and, where they arise, to address.  Critical policies that will help here include:\n\n - Whistleblower Policy - allowing any person to safely raise concerns\n - Risk management - identifying risks before they impact the organisation\n - Conflict of Interest - ensuring that conflicts of interest are pre-identified and avoided\n - Code of Conduct - acting in a professional manner in the best interests of the organisation\n - Fiduciary duties - acting in the best interests of the organization\n - Board Dispute Resolution - dealing with Board conflict when it arises\n\nFundamentally, avoiding serious breach and acting in the best interests of the organisation is a question of character, motivation and alignment for Responsible People, as well as having the skills to identify breach-triggering behaviour in the broader organisation.  A full Board assessment using the GovernApp Four Frames Framework is strongly recommended to help maximise your governance capability, Board effectiveness and organisational insight.",

      "There are four phases where your charity can ensure that there are no errors in your AIS or financial report.\n\nFirst, in preparation.  This includes the development of the materials, and their review and sign off by Executive Management, ready for submission to reviewers or auditors (depending on your revenue).  Care and attention to the preparation of these materials is, clearly, a major factor in ensuring that there are no errors in the materials you will submit to the ACNC.\n\nSecond is during the review or auditing phases, when independent scrutiny of the financial statements takes place.  This is an additional opportunity to identify and remove errors.  It is the reviewed\/audited accounts that are presented to the members at the AGM.\n\nThird is post AGM but prior to submission to the ACNC.  Changes to financial statements after they have been signed off by the board are relatively uncommon but can occur under certain circumstances. This might happen if material errors are discovered, new information emerges that significantly affects the financial data, or regulatory requirements change. In such cases, the charity may need to restate its financial statements, which involves revising and reissuing them with appropriate notes explaining the changes.\n\nFinally, your Charity may notice errors in its financial report after submission to the ACNC.  Restating financial statements is a serious action and usually reflects significant issues like non-compliance with accounting standards.  In these circumstances, your Charity's financial policies and procedures should trigger:\n\n - A review to identify any underlying problems in the charity's financial reporting processes or internal controls; and\n - The submission to the ACN of an amendment to your financial reports.\n\nSimilarly, any changes to your AIS should be submitted to the ACNC.",

This includes the development of the materials, and their review and sign off by Executive Management, ready for submission to reviewers or auditors (depending on your revenue).  Care and attention to the preparation of these materials is, clearly, a major factor in ensuring that there are no errors in the materials you will submit to the ACNC.\n\nSecond is during the review or auditing phases, when independent scrutiny of the financial statements takes place.  This is an additional opportunity to identify and remove errors.  It is the reviewed\/audited accounts that are presented to the members at the AGM.\n\nThird is post AGM but prior to submission to the ACNC.  Changes to financial statements after they have been signed off by the board are relatively uncommon but can occur under certain circumstances. This might happen if material errors are discovered, new information emerges that significantly affects the financial data, or regulatory requirements change. In such cases, the charity may need to restate its financial statements, which involves revising and reissuing them with appropriate notes explaining the changes.\n\nFinally, your Charity may notice errors in its financial report after submission to the ACNC.  Restating financial statements is a serious action and usually reflects significant issues like non-compliance with accounting standards.  In these circumstances, your Charity's financial policies and procedures should trigger:\n\n - A review to identify any underlying problems in the charity's financial reporting processes or internal controls; and\n - The submission to the ACN of an amendment to your financial reports.\n\nSimilarly, any changes to your AIS should be submitted to the ACNC.",

      "Breaches can be categorised into two key groups.  The first category can be termed procedural non-compliance.  This includes items such as: \n\n - Not submitting annual information statements, financial reports, or other required documentation by the specified deadlines.\n - Failing to advise the ACNC of changes to Responsible Persons\n - Failure to notify the ACNC of changes such as address, ABN and other notifiable items\n - Failing to adhere to the ACNC's governance standards, which require charities to operate in a way that is accountable, transparent, and aligns with their charitable purposes.\n\nThe second category can be termed serious legal breaches, and can include:\n\n - Using funds for non-charitable purposes, or for private gain rather than for the benefit of the public.\n - Engaging in activities that are not aligned with charitable purposes.\n - Submitting inaccurate or misleading information in reports or communications with the ACNC.\n - Engaging in illegal activities, including financial mismanagement, fraud, or other criminal behavior.\n - Not complying with directions issued by the ACNC to rectify issues within the charity.\n\nThe risks of procedural non-compliances are readily handled by the annual completion of a GovernApp review using the ACNC Charity Self-Evaluation framework (this framework).  This is designed to help you capture any inadvertent errors made or gaps in your systems.\n\nSerious legal breaches are more serious and rely on the fair and honest efforts of Responsible Persons to avoid and, where they arise, to address.  Critical policies that will help here include:\n\n - Whistleblower Policy - allowing any person to safely raise concerns\n - Risk management - identifying risks before they impact the organisation\n - Conflict of Interest - ensuring that conflicts of interest are pre-identified and avoided\n - Code of Conduct - acting in a professional manner in the best interests of the organisation\n - Fiduciary duties - acting in the best interests of the organization\n - Board Dispute Resolution - dealing with Board conflict when it arises\n\nFundamentally, avoiding serious breach and acting in the best interests of the organisation is a question of character, motivation and alignment for Responsible People, as well as having the skills to identify breach-triggering behaviour in the broader organisation.  A full Board assessment using the GovernApp Four Frames Framework is strongly recommended to help maximise your governance capability, Board effectiveness and organisational insight.",

GovernApp enables the generation of a Governance certificate which declares that the organisation has completed a governance review, the date of the review, and the participation of the Board.  Such a certificate demonstrates compliance intent and actual review to grant makers, donors, authorities and other stakeholders.',
